# MedrunnerTools 

This is a discord user app to ease the lead role in medrunner

There's only two features : 
- Status creation (allow you to create the status emoji thing with the time)
- Ship dispatcher


This project was eventually aborted due to other tools already existing that I didn't knew of at the time

# Use this project :
Get yourself a bot and fill in the bot token and app id in config.js


Profit ?
